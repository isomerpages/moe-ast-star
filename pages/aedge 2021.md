## aedge: Art Educators’ Developmental and Generative Explorations

![](/images/ig-event-poster.png)

_a x edge 2021_ is the 10th iteration of the aedge exhibition series showcasing the art practice of teacher-artists. The Roman numeral “x” chosen to mark the occasion, has multiple symbolisms. “x” marks our destinations, our preferred choices and also what we choose to cancel out. These ideas are explored by our teacher-artists in their personal inquiries and art making, presented in the following 3 thematic sections:

Longing examines places and situations we aspire to be in, and what it takes to get there. Teacher-artists in this section explore issues on refuge, personal memory and motivation, hope and uncertainties, communication and relationships.

Deliberation explores the processes, outcomes and effects of making choices among options. Subthemes of compassion, dealing with distractions and failure, and relinquishing control to chance, are explored in the artworks in this section.

Absence looks at perspectives and phenomena excluded due to systemic inequalities or erased by the passage of time. Subjects explored here range from language loss to urban conditions and the experiences of marginalised communities.

Through a variety of mediums ranging from drawing, painting, print to ceramics, sculpture, installation, video and performance, the participants investigate their concepts, motivations and obsessions. The specificity of the works highlights the extent of exploration of ‘x’ in the teacher-artists’ own terms and serves as starting points for new and ongoing dialogues.
