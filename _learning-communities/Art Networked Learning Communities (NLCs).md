Teachers in this NLC will hone their skills in leading open-ended discussions about works of art and gain different lesson ideas for museum-based learning. Sessions are held at various art museums so teachers will also get to look at art and be inspired by artistsâ€™ ideas.

This NLC provides the platform for interested teachers to experience design thinking as a form of critical inquiry, and to use it to inform teaching. Over time, this Design Thinking NLC will also explore how design thinking can be taught as an alternative inquiry approach, so as to support artistic creations and design iterations.  

### Critical Inquiry NLC
