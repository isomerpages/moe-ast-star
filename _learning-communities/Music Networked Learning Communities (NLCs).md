<p>Networked Learning Communities (NLC) are organised to ignite passion and
inspire synergistic collaborations in developing professional mastery in
music and music teaching practice. The NLCs span across multiple interest
areas such as pedagogical practices, teaching routines and instrumentation.
Teachers enhance their classroom practice by sharing their practice knowledge
and pedagogical knowledge, and networking with one another. One example
is the Critical Inquiry Networked Learning Community which provides a professional
development opportunity through reflective inquiry based practices.&nbsp;STAR
also has an active online music teachers network on Facebook. With more
than 1,000 members,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/Musicators/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Musicators!</a></em>&nbsp;is
a closed Facebook group which offers music teachers a platform to share
resources, discuss teaching experiences, and provide professional support
for one another.</p>
