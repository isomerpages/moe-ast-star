Networked Learning Communities (NLC) are organised to ignite passion and inspire synergistic collaborations in developing professional mastery in music and music teaching practice. The NLCs span across multiple interest areas such as pedagogical practices, teaching routines and instrumentation. Teachers enhance their classroom practice by sharing their practice knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, and networking with one another. One example is the Critical Inquiry Networked Learning Community which provides a professional development opportunity through reflective inquiry based practices.&nbsp;STAR also has an active online music teachers network on Facebook.
