![4.3 Art STAR Champions_Photo1](/images/43artstarchampionsphoto1.jpg)

The STAR Champions programme deepens Art teachers’ teaching and pedagogical leadership competencies, and nurture a teacher-led culture within the arts fraternity.

Nominated by their Cluster Superintendents, Art STAR Champions are acknowledged for their instructional leadership, dedication and passion towards their subject disciplines. They will attend a range of customized workshops that will deepen their understanding of student-centric strategies to nurture 21st century competencies. They will work with fellow Art STAR Champions to lead other teachers in their clusters and/or zones and advocate for the art fraternity.

The STAR Champions programme develops teacher leadership and teaching competencies of Art teachers. STAR Champions are teacher leaders nominated by cluster superintendents and supported by their respective school principals. Through professional development workshops, mentoring by Art master teachers, and exchanges with peers, the programme broadens teacher leaders’ pedagogical repertoire, deepens their pedagogical understandings, and strengthens the teacher-led collaborative culture within the arts teaching fraternity. STAR Champions lead their cluster art teachers by conducting workshops that advance pedagogical understandings of student-centric art education.
