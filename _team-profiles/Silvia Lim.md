She advocates for making Art universally accessible, viewing it as a potent tool for self-expression.

Beyond teaching, Silvia discovers joy in pottery and leatherwork, extending her artistic exploration outside the classroom. These activities serve as personal outlets and contribute to her continuous understanding of diverse creative mediums. In her free time, Silvia practises bouldering.She finds bouldering particularly invigorating, recognizing how it not only challenges the body but also stimulates the mind.
