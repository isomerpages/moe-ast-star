<p>Silvia brings nine years of valuable teaching experience from Qifa Primary
School, where she advocates for a "play to learn" approach, creating an
engaging environment for her students. With a passion for Art Pedagogy,
she actively explores innovative methods to elevate the impact of Art Education.
Silvia's teaching philosophy centres on a deep belief in the boundless
imagination of children, fascinated by how it evolves as they grow. She
advocates for making Art universally accessible, viewing it as a potent
tool for self-expression.</p>
<p>Beyond teaching, Silvia discovers joy in pottery and leatherwork, extending
her artistic exploration outside the classroom. These activities serve
as personal outlets and contribute to her continuous understanding of diverse
creative mediums. In her free time, Silvia practises bouldering.She finds
bouldering particularly invigorating, recognizing how it not only challenges
the body but also stimulates the mind. Excited about joining AST, Silvia

with the academy's commitment to innovative Art Education.</p>
