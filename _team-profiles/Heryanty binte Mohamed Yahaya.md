Heryanty believes that Art educators pave the way for students’ growth in critical thinking and verbal skills by challenging students with different points of view to be reflective learners. She also believes that Art education can connect people across disciplines more deeply and open them up to new ways of seeing. She maintains that a strong Art programme in school can level up social gaps for all students. Prior to joining STAR, she was the Head of Department for Aesthetics in Yio Chu Kang Primary School where she led the school’s Learning for Life Programme to enable every child a more level playing field - developing students into confident and self-directed learners through a myriad of Arts experiences; and active contributors and concerned citizens through community engagement in the Arts.
