<p>Nurul brings nine years of enriching experience from Mayflower Secondary
School, where she harnessed the transformative power of art education to
support her students' holistic growth and well-being.</p>
<p>Viewing the Arts as a catalyst for growth, Nurul emphasizes creating safe
spaces for authentic self-expression in order to foster empathy and belonging.
Passionate about each studentâ€™s creative potential, she empowers them to
explore social issues, reflect deeply, and find their place in the world.
She believes that the heartwork of teaching is in itself a true art form.</p>
<p>Having recently overcome cancer, Nurul holds a profound appreciation for
holistic wellness and the strength found in community. She dedicates much
of her time to exploring holistic health, guided by her belief that thriving
individuals are those who are empowered to care for themselves and those
around them.</p>
