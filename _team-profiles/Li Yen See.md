<p>Mrs Li Yen See studied Music and Psychology, and Music and Performing
Arts Education in the United Kingdom, and returned in 1994 to teach music
in Singapore. She was previously Dean of Music and the Arts at Anglo-Chinese
School (Independent) before joining STAR as Programme Manager (Music).
Some of the programmes she helped to develop in ACS (Independent) were
the IBDP Music curriculum and the Arts Education Programme. She believes
peer-to-peer professional collaboration is helpful in reviewing and improving
teachersâ€™ practices in the classroom. The exchange of pedagogical ideas
and collaboration within the fraternity builds teachers' capacity.</p>
