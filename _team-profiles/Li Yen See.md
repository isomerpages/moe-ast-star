Mrs Li Yen See studied Music and Psychology, and Music and Performing Arts Education in the United Kingdom, and returned in 1994 to teach music in Singapore. She was previously Dean of Music and the Arts at Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) before joining STAR as Programme Manager (Music). Some of the programmes she helped to develop in ACS (Independent) were the IBDP Music curriculum and the Arts Education Programme. She believes peer-to-peer professional collaboration is helpful in reviewing and improving teachersâ€™ practices in the classroom. The exchange of pedagogical ideas and collaboration within the fraternity builds teachers' capacity.
