**Melissa** obtained her MMus and BMus (Hons) in Cello and Baroque Cello Performance from the Royal College of Music (RCM) with the support of a full MOE Teaching Scholarship and awards from the RCM, and is currently pursuing a Doctor of Music Arts (DMA) in Music Education. She believes that arts education provides educators and students with unique ways of knowing, doing, and being in the world. Prior to joining STAR, Melissa was a STAR Champion and Music Coordinator at Hai Sing Catholic School, where she developed the Lower Secondary Music and N(T) Music curricula. She also established the HSC Underground, an inclusive space for students to share their passion for music across streams, interests, and abilities. In her spare time, she conducts and performs as a professional cellist, and hopes to continue improving in music production, guitar and bass.
