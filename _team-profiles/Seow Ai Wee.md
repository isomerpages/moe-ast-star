<p>Ms Seow Ai Wee designs and conducts professional learning experiences
to enhance teaching competencies of Art Teachers in areas of inquiry-based
learning, differentiated instruction and technology-enhanced art learning.&nbsp;She
also produces video-based resources focused on the works and life of contemporary
Singapore artists to highlight how artistic practice might inspire new
ways of teaching. Her two-year secondment (2021-2023) to the National Arts
Council as Deputy Director for Education has motivated her to examine possibilities
to foster closer collaboration in the art and art education ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ai Wee began her teaching career as an Art Teacher at Outram Secondary
School in 2000. While pursuing her master's degree at Teachers College,
Columbia University in New York City, she joined the Museum of Modern Art,
first as Teaching Resident and then as Museum Educator. She went on to
work at the Whitney Museum of American Art as the Coordinator of School
and Teacher Programs. After nine years in the art museum sector, Ai Wee
took on an Assistant Professor position in the Arts Education Department
at Tamagawa University, Tokyo, where she taught undergraduate classes on
museum education, artistic development of children and adolescents, and
learning English through art.</p>
