<p>Felicia believes in the importance of instilling in her students the confidence
to take risks, explore their own musical identities, and contribute to
the world through their artistic expression. Before joining STAR, she had
a 3-year stint at the Arts Education Branch as an Arts Education Officer
and was later posted to Concord Primary School as the Subject Head of Aesthetics.
At Concord Primary School, her passion for Arts exploration and expression
led to the conceptualisation of the Artspression Lodge, where students
can make Art and Music with their peers during recess time and freely express
themselves with the resources provided, while bonding with their friends.</p>
