Mr Chia Wei Hou is driven by a firm and fervor belief that art education can shape students’ lives in many positive and resounding ways—that had been his reason to become an Art teacher since 1999.

Before being appointed as Master Teacher in 2023, he taught art in Jurong Junior College, National Junior College, and former Raffles Junior College and Raffles Institution. During the journey, Wei Hou spearheaded a number of pedagogical initiatives, such as Place-based Learning/ Experiential Learning. Being big advocate of Serious Play, he constantly devised his art lessons through playful experimentation with medium and material, and through the use of role-playing to perform creative act of re-enactment of ideas and possibilities.

Wei Hou have always perceived teaching as an art form: when it is well designed and beautifully conducted-like experiencing a beautiful artwork-it can open one’s eyes, enrich one’s heart, provoke one’s mind to become more discerning and eloquent. To him, a skillful teacher is an artist—endows students with unforgettable aesthetic experiences in learning.
