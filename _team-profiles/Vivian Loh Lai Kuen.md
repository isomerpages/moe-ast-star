<p><strong>Vivian</strong>&nbsp;sees teaching as a vocation and a service
to others, and she is thankful for the opportunity to serve as an art teacher
at the secondary and junior college levels. Indeed, many lives were touched
over the past twenty-eight years due to her steadfast belief in bringing
out the best in every child. Her roles as Head of Department, as well as
School Staff Developer, have also enabled her to work closely with colleagues
from different backgrounds. These experiences have hones her people skills,
and developed in her an appreciation for diverse thinking. She is excited
to be part of the team working at the Singapore Teachers Academy for the
aRts and hopes to contribute by using her formative experiences to add
to the academy's mission of building a community of excellent arts teachers.
Vivian holds a Masters in Art Education from Maryland Institute College
of Art, America.</p>
