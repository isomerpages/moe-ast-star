Matthew believes the ability to appreciate and partake actively within the arts allows us to connect more deeply with one another and within. Prior to joining STAR, he served as the Subject Head (Aesthetics and CCA) at Kheng Cheng School, where he oversaw the development of the Art and Music Curriculum and implementation of programmes to raise a culture of engagement in the arts. Matthew holds Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Education degrees from the University of Toronto. He advocates the arts as a medium to develop self-confidence and build meaningful relationships.
