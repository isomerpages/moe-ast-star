Mdm Ang Hwee Loo had served a few stints in MOE HQ; in the Curriculum Planning & Development Division as an Art Specialist (1999-2003) and in the Student Development Curriculum Division, Arts Education Branch (2012-2014), where she was involved in the pioneering work of setting up a new branch overseeing Visual Arts, Music, Dance and Drama Education in the schools.  Upon completion of her Leaders in Education Programme (2010) and her Masters in Curriculum and Teaching & Learning (2014-2015), she was posted to Rulang Primary School as a Vice-Principal.  
  
In her capacity as a school leader and a strategic partner to the stakeholders and parent, Hwee Loo would always take the opportunity to advocate for Arts Education whenever she had the chance to engage them through the various school platforms and activities.  She would lead the parents in activities such as Art Jamming and conduct pottery sessions for members of the School Advisory Board and Alumni, for she believes that parents and the community at large, have a critical role to play in the holistic development of children.  It is essential for them to see the value that learning in the arts bring to the cultivation of skills and habits of mind that are crucial for children to succeed and thrive in the 21st century.  
  
With her current posting and appointment, Hwee Loo’s role in AST/STAR is still very much connected to her passion in the arts.  With her transition from school to MOE HQ, Hwee Loo will be able to offer schools’ perspectives on how STAR may enhance and strengthen the professional practice of our Art teachers in the fraternity.  Teachers are the key to quality education - “It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge” (Albert Einstein).  Together with the team of Master Teachers, Hwee Loo is committed to build a community of excellent art educators and to improve the quality of Art Education in our schools.
