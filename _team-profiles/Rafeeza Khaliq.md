**Rafeeza** advocates that artistic exploration is a powerful platform for children to discover their personal voice and to find meaning in the world they live in. She believes that art teachers play a critical role in creating meaningful opportunities for students to connect the dots and be empowered to navigate and be a collaborator in the classroom. Prior to joining STAR, she was the HOD Aesthetics at St Margaret’s Primary School working together with her team to build an empowering and vibrant arts culture in the school. In her time there, she oversaw the Student Leadership Development programme, Partnership Committee, Programme for Active Learning, the visual and performing arts CCAs, and the arts curriculum.

Besides her passion for art education, Feeza is also passionate about the environment and the work around empowering young women. She is a volunteer with the Worldwide Organisation for Organic Farming and volunteers at a sustainable dairy farm in Hokkaido, Japan yearly. She is a member of the camp committee at Girl Guides Singapore (GGS) where she organises camps for GGS.  She is also a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGS).
