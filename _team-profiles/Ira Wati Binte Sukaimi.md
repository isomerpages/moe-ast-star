A passionate educator and a strong advocate for the visual arts, Mdm Ira Wati Binte Sukaimi believes that the quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers. As such, she constantly strives to improve the collective efficacy of the fraternity through effective and relevant PD.

Mdm Ira was a member of the MOE Ethos and Code Outreach Committee (ECOC) from 2017-2018 and member of the MOE Teachers’ Council from 2019-2020, both chaired by the DyDGE and DGE respectively. She also served as a panel member of the National Arts Council, Arts Education Programme from 2017 to 2020.   
  
Over a span of more than 20 years, Mdm Ira has taught the Art Elective Programme as well as the ‘O’, ‘NA’ and ‘NT’ general art curriculum. Prior to her appointment as Master Teacher (Art) in 2022, she taught in CHIJ Secondary, in Holy Innocents’ High School as Senior Teacher (Art) and in Mayflower Secondary as a Lead Teacher (Art). She served as a Programme Manager at the Singapore Teachers’ Academy for the aRts (STAR) from 2012-2015.   
  
Through the social capital she has forged over the years, Mdm Ira strives to create contexts that evoke teacher leadership through a shared sense of purpose and commitment, which inevitably help Art teachers evolve as leaders.
