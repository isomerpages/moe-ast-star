**_Drawing Learners: Perspectives on Art Education_**Â celebrates the imaginative and scholarly work undertaken by art teachers. It illustrates reflection on teaching practices, critical thinking, inquiry and how art teachers might question and internalise learner-centred approaches to art teaching and learning. At a meta-narrative level, this monograph hopes to address some misconceptions about the intellectual and pedagogical considerations of art teaching.
