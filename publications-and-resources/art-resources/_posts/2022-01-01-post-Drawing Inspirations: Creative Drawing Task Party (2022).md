This Creative Drawing Task Party set is an expansion of the previous Drawing Inspirations: Making discoveries through observations, imagination, and expression (2020). To foster self-directed learners, teachers and students are invited to choose one or a few cards randomly or based on personal interest. They could also use all the cards to work on individual drawings in their visual journals independently or in groups, collaborating with their peers to broaden their drawing learning experiences and immerse in the magic of drawing. Through drawing, they will observe, imagine, co-create, and express their ideas and engage in the process of self-discovery.

This set of cards comprises 24 unique creative drawing exercises categorized into 3 different types:

*   Type 1: Recording and Depicting Experiences and Observations
*   Type 2: Drawing from Imagination
*   Type 3: Collaborative Drawing: Co-creating Layers of Meaning
