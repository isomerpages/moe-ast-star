<br><strong>The Brief Box</strong> supports teachers and students in engaging
with the design process. This curated collection of <strong>60 design briefs</strong> is
organised into <strong>four generative topics</strong> aligned to the <strong>three Big Ideas</strong> of
the art syllabus. An accompanying guidebook features essays by STAR’s design
partners in education. Each brief provides structure while inviting open
inquiry, offering clarity in lesson design while allowing creativity to
emerge within authentic constraints.</p>
