<br><strong>The Brief Box</strong> supports teachers and students in engaging
with the design process. This curated collection of <strong>60 design briefs</strong> is
organised into <strong>four generative topics</strong> aligned to the <strong>three Big Ideas</strong> of
the art syllabuses. An accompanying guidebook features essays by STAR’s
design partners in education. Each brief provides structure while inviting
open inquiry, offering clarity in lesson design while allowing creativity
to emerge within authentic constraints.
