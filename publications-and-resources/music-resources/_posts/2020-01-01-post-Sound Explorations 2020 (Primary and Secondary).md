Sound Explorations 2020 (Primary and Secondary)

Sound Explorations 2020 compiles 21 curriculum plans with sample assessment rubrics designed by the Music STAR Champions to achieve the learning outcomes for the Primary and Lower Secondary music syllabus. Aimed to lift readers' thinking beyond the mere methodology of content delivery, the presence of ‘big ideas’ undergird the different curriculum plans to give a larger rationale and purpose to why the module is important.
