Stories We Sing

Stories We Sing is a pedagogical resource designed to support professional development of music teachers. It is a collaboration between STAR and National Arts Council. 

For the first time, 19 educators and artists have come together to create 12 commissioned new songs with the aim to enhance quality music teaching and learning in the music classroom.  

The resource consists of an audio CD of the songs, a book publication and 50 lesson ideas designed by music teachers.  

Grouped under the four themes of "Deepening Roots", "Growing Communities", "Moving Landscapes" and "Living Life", the commissioned songs express throughts on Singapore's urban landscape, national icons and local traditional festivals, among other elements.  

As the lyrics cover authentic reflections of life in Singapore, both students and teachers will be able to identify the songs with their own daily experiences.  Through these songs, students will have the opportunity to develop a rich music founded on the various musical cultures that abound in Singapore. They will also imbue in students a sense of identity and rootedness towards Singapore. 

Songs sung in the vernacular languages will hep to engender cross-cultural understanding and appreciation among students.  Teachers can also design relevant and varied musical experiences for their students, allowing them to find more meaning in their learning, and develop a greater interest in music.
