Sounding the Teaching VI: Imagining Possibilities

This e-publication features 26 studies conducted by teachers from STAR’s Critical Inquiry Networked Learning Community (CI NLC). The studies celebrate the teachers’ spirit of inquiry and document how they explored a range of pedagogical approaches and adapted existing practices to design and deliver engaging and student-centric curriculum to adjust to the new contexts presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through collaborations and discussions, not only were they able to grow in their pedagogical practices, they were also able to gain a deeper understanding in the various domains under Skills Future for Educators (SFEd).

The e-publication is divided into nine sections:

1.  e-Pedagogy - Facilitating Conceptual Changes
2.  e-Pedagogy – Facilitating Flipped Learning
3.  e-Pedagogy - Harnessing technology in Music-making
4.  e-Pedagogy – Personalising Learning through Technology
5.  e-Pedagogy and Assessment for Learning
6.  Character and Citizenship Education
7.  Inquiry-based Learning
8.  Differentiated Instruction
9.  Special Learning Needs and Differentiated Instruction
