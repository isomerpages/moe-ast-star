<p>This e-publication features 20 studies conducted by teachers from STAR’s
Music Critical Inquiry Networked Learning Community (CI NLC).</p>
<p>The theme ‘Imagining Possibilities in Changing Times’ was conceived to
encourage teachers to explore innovations in their respective changing
classroom contexts such as transiting out of the COVID-19 pandemic or embarking
on the Full Subject-Based Banding initiative to engage heterogenous classes.</p>
<p>Through the CI NLC, teachers exercised adaptability, creativity, and criticality
in leading innovation to enhance teaching and learning in the music classroom.</p>
<p>Their teaching approaches and findings are presented according to the
six SkillsFuture for Educators (SFEd) areas:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Social and Emotional Learning
<br>2.&nbsp; Assessment for Learning
<br>3.&nbsp; Differentiated Instruction
<br>4.&nbsp; e-Pedagogy
<br>5.&nbsp; Inquiry-Based Learning
<br>6.&nbsp; Supporting Students with Special Education Needs</p>
