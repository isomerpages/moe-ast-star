<p>This publication presents insights and findings from seven music&nbsp;teacher-leaders,
who embarked on critical inquiry projects to investigate how their learners
experience their lessons in the areas of music composition, music performance,
music learning, music assessment and the mentoring process. A variety of
approaches were used to examine their own music&nbsp;teaching&nbsp;practices
and we hope that the reflections on their own assumptions and practices
could inspire us to also reconsider and re-examine the ways we engage our
students.</p>
