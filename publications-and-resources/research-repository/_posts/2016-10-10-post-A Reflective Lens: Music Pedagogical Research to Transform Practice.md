<p>The Arts Pedagogical Research Fund (APRF) goes beyond research funding
to provide teachers a year-long professional development programme in pedagogical
research. The journey sees the teachers steeped in reflective inquiry,
as they research on a pedagogical approach applied in their classroom.
Read about the teachers’ learning and research findings in this publication,
which features teacher-researchers from these schools:</p>
