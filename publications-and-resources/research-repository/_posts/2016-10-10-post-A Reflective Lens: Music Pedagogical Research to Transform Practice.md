The Arts Pedagogical Research Fund (APRF) goes beyond research funding to provide teachers a year-long professional development programme in pedagogical research. The journey sees the teachers steeped in reflective inquiry, as they research on a pedagogical approach applied in their classroom. Read about the teachers’ learning and research findings in this publication, which features teacher-researchers from these schools:

*   Jurongville Secondary School
*   Juying Primary School
*   St Patrick’s School
*   Tampines Primary School
