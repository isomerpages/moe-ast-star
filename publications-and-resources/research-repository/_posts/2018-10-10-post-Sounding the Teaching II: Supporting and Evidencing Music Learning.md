<p>Extending from the investigations in the first issue of Sounding the Teaching,
this volume presents insights and findings from eight music&nbsp;teacher-leaders,
who embarked on critical inquiry projects as part of a Networked Learning
Community, to explore assessment practices to better support student learning.&nbsp;</p>
