<p>STAR and PESTA (Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy) conducted
a longitudinal research from 2013 to 2014, to study the impact of PE, Art
and Music (PAM) pedagogies on the delivery of 21st century competencies
(21CC) and student learning outcomes. The research sought to establish
the significance of PAM in developing 21CC that will constitute the social
capital for nation building. This publication presents the findings from
the research, and pedagogical considerations for the PE, Art and Music
classrooms to nurture 21st century competencies in students.&nbsp;</p>
