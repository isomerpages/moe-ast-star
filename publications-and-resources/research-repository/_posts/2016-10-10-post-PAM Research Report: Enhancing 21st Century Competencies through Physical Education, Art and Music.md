STAR and PESTA (Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy) conducted a longitudinal research from 2013 to 2014, to study the impact of PE, Art and Music (PAM) pedagogies on the delivery of 21st century competencies (21CC) and student learning outcomes. The research sought to establish the significance of PAM in developing 21CC that will constitute the social capital for nation building.
