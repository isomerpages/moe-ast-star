Upskilling programmes aim to level up the pedagogical knowledge and skills, as well as art competencies, of teachers wishing to specialise in art.

### Art Teacher Practitioner Programme
  
The Art Teacher Practitioner Programme (ATPP) serves as a bridging course to equip primary school teachers without prior pre-service art training with the basic pedagogical skills for classroom art teaching.
