The STAR Champions programme deepens Art teachers’ teaching and pedagogical leadership competencies, and nurture a teacher-led culture within the arts fraternity. Nominated by their Cluster Superintendents, Art STAR Champions are acknowledged for their instructional leadership, dedication and passion towards their subject disciplines. They will attend a range of customized workshops that will deepen their understanding of student-centric strategies to nurture 21st century competencies. They will work with fellow Art STAR Champions to lead other teachers in their clusters and/or zones and advocate for the art fraternity.

Designed for STs and LTs (Art/Music), this professional learning support programme aims to develop our teacher leaders’ competencies as pedagogical leaders. The course focuses on deepening participants’ disciplinary thinking, and keeping them updated on emergent trends in arts pedagogy and professional practice. The STAR ST/LTs’ Programme is designed to complement the Academy of Singapore Teachers’ (AST) Teacher Leader Programme 1 and 2 (TLP1 and TLP2). It is strongly recommended that Art and Music STs and LTs attend both the TLP1/2 and STAR ST/LT Programme within the first five years of their appointment. Teachers can select the order of their professional learning sequence to better suit their own learning needs.

### Professional Dialogues with Master Teachers

These sessions are for teachers to find out more about the roles of Senior Teachers, Lead Teachers and Master Teachers in Art as well as to learn how to chart their own professional growth and development.  

### Professional Clinics

Teachers who aspire to be on the Teaching Track and are working towards being appointed can receive personalised guidance from Master Teachers for the preparation of their professional portfolio and appointment interview.

### Teacher Work Attachment

STAR offers customised Teacher Work Attachment (TWA) for potential and appointed teacher-leaders who are keen to understand STAR's work in advancing professional development for Art and Music teachers and on building the professional identity of the fraternity. TWA @ STAR can be once or twice a week over one term or semester.
