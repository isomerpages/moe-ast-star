The 2-day programme will equip teachers with art teaching strategies that are process-orientated and support the development of 21st century competencies. Teachers will get to experiment with materials, explore art making processes, and learn how to design art lessons using STAR’s Learning Art Through Inquiry framework. They will also visit an art museum and learn to lead discussions about art using STAR's Let's Talk About Art prompt cards.
