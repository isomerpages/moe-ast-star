Engaging with Songs is a special professional development programme designed by STAR to deepen music teachers' pedagogical understanding in leading singing in the music classroom. It also aims to build a repertoire of songs, including those of our multicultural traditions, to engender cross-cultural understanding through music. It is envisioned that the programme helps build a singing culture in classrooms and in schools.

This programme provides a suite of professional learning platforms including workshops by master pedagogues, overseas learning journeys, lesson demonstrations, as well as collaborative discussions and reflection by the teachers. Teachers take away valuable lessons on how to teach singing in the classroom, and develop a greater sense of confidence in singing.

The programme culminates in an event called “Engaging with Songs Day”, where teacher participants and their students come together to experience the joy of singing in a professional concert venue. The programme not only helps to build teachers’ and students’ confidence in their voices, but also fosters a greater sense of camaraderie within the fraternity.

The third video features teachers' sharing how their pedagogy has developed, and how students are more engaged in their music lessons through singing.
