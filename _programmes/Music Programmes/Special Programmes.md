<p>Engaging with Songs is a special professional development programme designed
by STAR to deepen music teachers' pedagogical understanding in leading
singing in the music classroom. It also aims to build a repertoire of songs,
including those of our multicultural traditions, to engender cross-cultural
understanding through music. It is envisioned that the programme helps
build a singing culture in classrooms and in schools.</p>
<p>This programme provides a suite of professional learning platforms including
workshops by master pedagogues, overseas learning journeys, lesson demonstrations,
as well as collaborative discussions and reflection by the teachers. Teachers
take away valuable lessons on how to teach singing in the classroom, and
develop a greater sense of confidence in singing.</p>
<p>The programme culminates in an event called “Engaging with Songs Day”,
where teacher participants and their students come together to experience
the joy of singing in a professional concert venue. The programme not only
helps to build teachers’ and students’ confidence in their voices, but
also fosters a greater sense of camaraderie within the fraternity.</p>
<p>Find out more about the Engaging with Songs programme in the following
videos. The first video shares the culmination of the first phase of Engaging
with Songs in 2014, with round robins of music teaching, and singing games
for students from the 7 pioneer schools in the programme. The second video
presents an overview of Engaging with Songs programme in 2015, presenting
the perspectives of students, teachers and school leaders who were involved.
The third video features teachers' sharing how their pedagogy has developed,
and how students are more engaged in their music lessons through singing.</p>
