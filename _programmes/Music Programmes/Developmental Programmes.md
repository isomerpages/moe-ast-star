<p>Developmental programmes help teachers to deepen their pedagogical understandings,
and achieve professional renewal and gain transformation in teaching beliefs
and practices.</p>
<h3>Music-Specific Pedagogies</h3>
<p>Music-specific pedagogies such as Orff, Kodály and Dalcroze provide ideas
for student-centric approaches to engaging students in music learning.
Active engagement through authentic music experiences such as listening,
singing, movement, drama, improvisation, body percussion, instrumental
playing and creative expression are fundamental to these pedagogies. Teachers
develop a stronger grasp of the scaffolding processes for effective music
lessons, and get the chance to experience how each pedagogical approach
enhances classroom learning for students.</p>
<p>Since 2014, workshops focusing on music-specific pedagogies have been
conducted to deepen the teachers' pedagogical understanding.</p>
<h3>Kodály Approach for Student-centric Music Lessons (Primary only)</h3>
<p><strong>Creative Music Making with Kodály-inspired Approach </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>FOR</strong>: Experienced Teachers
<br><strong>PERIOD</strong>: At least one run per year</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The Kodály approach uses a sequential method with child-developmental
perspectives to develop music understanding and literacy in students. Premised
on the belief that there are multiple dimensions to musicianship training,
the approach advocates the use of music experiences such as listening,
singing, movement and games to build up skills and knowledge of music concepts.</p>
<p>Working with Kodály specialist instructors, the programme is designed
to introduce the Kodály approach and how it can be used to develop music
skills and concepts in a student-centric approach. Teachers are also provided
with opportunity to apply their understanding through micro-teaching.</p>
<h3>Orff Approach to Music Education</h3>
<p><strong>FOR</strong>: Experienced Teachers
<br><strong>PERIOD</strong>: At least one run per year</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Milestone Programme (Orff Approach)" src="/images/orffapproach.jpg">
</div>
<p>The Orff Approach is premised upon a learner-centered environment where
children learn with an element of “play” through the integration of speech,
movement and music. With a focus on improvisation and composition, music
concepts are acquired through active engagement in singing, chanting, dance,
movement and playing of percussion instruments (e.g. xylophones, metallophones).</p>
<p>The programme develops teachers’ understanding of the Orff approach. It
also provides opportunities for teachers to analyse, plan and apply their
understanding in group micro-teaching sessions throughout the workshop.</p>
<h3>Dalcroze Approach to Music Education</h3>
<p><strong>FOR</strong>: Experienced Teachers
<br><strong>PERIOD</strong>: At least one run per year</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/dalcroze-min.jpg">
</div>
<p>The Dalcroze Approach - eurhythmics, solfège and improvisation - is an
effective way to develop deeper musicality and creative expression through
whole body movement and space. In this approach, the teaching of music
incorporates meaningful rhythmic movement in the learning experience for
a deeper understanding of music concepts. With a focus on improvisation
and expressions of an individual’s musical ideas through the movement of
the body through space, the approach not only creates an environment where
creativity and experiential learning flourish, but also allows curricular
objectives like rhythm, structure, mood and tone to be explored.</p>
<p>The programme focuses on eurhythmics and improvisation to facilitate learning
of music concepts in the student-centric classroom, and involves teachers
in group micro-teaching to apply their pedagogical learning.</p>

<h3>Teaching Living Legends</h3>
<p><strong>FOR</strong>: Experienced Teachers
<br><strong>PERIOD</strong>: At least one run per year</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/teaching-living-legends-min.jpg">

<p>Teaching Living Legends is a milestone programme designed by STAR to address
the teaching of Singapore living music traditions in the context of the
21st century student-centric classroom. This programme supports teachers
in their implementation of the Primary and Lower Secondary Music syllabus
by developing them in music pedagogy, practice and perspective in relation
to the teaching of Singapore music. Teachers explore how Singapore music
traditions are kept relevant to students via the stories and narratives
behind these pieces of music, thus providing engaging music experiences
and raising awareness of Singapore's unique musical identity.</p>
<p>The workshops are conducted by our Music Master Teachers in collaboration
with Singapore music practitioners, who are experts in their respective
fields. The programme is run in the form of blended-learning, which includes
workshops run over four full-days plus an online learning component completed
on the OPAL learning portal. Find out more about the Teaching Living Legends
