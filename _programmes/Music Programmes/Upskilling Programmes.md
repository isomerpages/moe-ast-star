MOE collaborates with the National Institute of Education (NIE) to offer the full-time in-service Advanced Diploma in Primary Music Education for teachers without the requisite qualifications to teach the subject. This is aligned with MOE’s aim of enhancing the quality of music instruction in primary schools.  
  
The programme is designed to build on the knowledge and skills of teachers who were trained to teach music as a third subject, and equips them with the essential breadth and depth of content knowledge and competencies to deliver quality music lessons to students.  
  
The duration of each full-time course is four months. Upon completion of the course, the teacher will be required to serve a minimum of 1 year (full-time) in the school.
