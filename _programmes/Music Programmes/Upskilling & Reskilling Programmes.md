<p>The Music Teacher Practitioner Programme (MTPP) serves as a bridging course
to equip primary school teachers who are without prior pre-service music
training with the basic pedagogical skills for classroom music teaching.</p>
<p>Teacher participants develop their music practice through participation
in various solo and group performances. The MTPP programme includes the
following components:</p>

<p>MOE collaborates with the National Institute of Education (NIE) to offer
the full-time in-service Advanced Diploma in Primary Music Education for
teachers without the requisite qualifications to teach the subject. This
is aligned with MOEâ€™s aim of enhancing the quality of music instruction
in primary schools.</p>
<p>The programme is designed to build on the knowledge and skills of teachers
who were trained to teach music as a third subject, and equips them with
the essential breadth and depth of content knowledge and competencies to
deliver quality music lessons to students.</p>
<p>The duration of each full-time course is four months. Upon completion
of the course, the teacher will be required to serve a minimum of 1 year
(full-time) in the school.</p>
