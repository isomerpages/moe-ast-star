![2.4.5 Supporting Programmes on Music Practice](/images/245supportingprogrammesonmusicpractice.jpg)

Based on interests and professional learning needs, STAR has mounted several courses, masterclasses and learning journeys to broaden teachers' perspectives and deepen their pedagogical and music practice. STAR has also mounted courses to enhance teachers' and Allied Educators' knowledge and skills in specific areas of music syllabuses and/or extend their music competencies and perspectives.  
  
Some supporting programmes aim to provide teachers with just-in-time professional learning focussed on enhancing their music and teaching practice for musical skills and knowledge that supports music classroom teaching. Past courses conducted include the gamelan, African drums, ukulele, guitar and keyboard.
