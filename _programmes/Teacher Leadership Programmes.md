<p>The STAR Champions programme deepens Art teachers’ teaching and pedagogical
leadership competencies, and nurtures a teacher-led culture within the
arts fraternity. Nominated by their Cluster Superintendents, Art STAR Champions
are acknowledged for their instructional leadership, dedication and passion
towards their subject disciplines. They will attend a range of customised
workshops that will deepen their understanding of student-centric strategies
to nurture 21st century competencies. They will work with fellow Art STAR
Champions to lead other teachers and advocate for the art fraternity.</p>

</div>
<p>Designed for STs and LTs (Art/Music), this professional learning support
programme aims to develop our teacher leaders’ competencies as pedagogical
leaders. The course focuses on deepening participants’ disciplinary thinking,
and keeping them updated on emergent trends in arts pedagogy and professional
practice. The STAR ST/LTs’ Programme is designed to complement the Academy
of Singapore Teachers’ (AST) Teacher Leader Programme 1 and 2 (TLP1 and
TLP2). It is strongly recommended that Art and Music STs and LTs attend
both the TLP1/2 and STAR ST/LT Programme within the first five years of
their appointment. Teachers can select the order of their professional
learning sequence to better suit their own learning needs.</p>
<h3>Milestone Programme - Professional Dialogues with Master Teachers</h3>
<p>These sessions are for teachers to find out more about the roles of Senior
Teachers, Lead Teachers and Master Teachers in Art as well as to learn
how to chart their own professional growth and development.</p>
<h3>STAR Clinic Sessions for Nominated Art Senior Teachers and Lead Teachers</h3>
<p>Teachers who aspire to be on the Teaching Track and are working towards
being appointed can receive personalised guidance from Master Teachers
for the preparation of their professional portfolio and appointment interview.</p>
<h3>Teacher Work Attachment Plus</h3>
<p>STAR offers customised Teacher Work Attachment Plus (TWA+) for potential
and appointed teacher-leaders who are keen to understand STAR’s work in
advancing professional development for Art and Music teachers and on building
the professional identity of the fraternity. TWA+ @ STAR can be once or
