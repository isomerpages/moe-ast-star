<p>The theme of TCEF2023 is ‘Ignite Imagination. Empower Communities. Transform
Practice’. It reinforces our fraternity’s emphasis on lifelong learning
and supports us to continually deepen our beliefs, better understand our
students, and further strengthen our classroom practice to nurture future-ready
learners.</p>
