<p>Teachers’ Conference and ExCEL Fest (TCEF) is the apex conference for
Singapore teachers to affirm and celebrate the spirit of professional learning
amongst teachers. The conference aims to bring local educators together
to learn, to connect and to engage with thought leaders and practitioners,
as we explore possibilities for the future of teaching and learning. Over
the years, the Teachers’ Conference has incorporated the MOE Innergy and
Outstanding Innovation Awards Ceremony, the MOE ExCEL Fest, the Conference
for the Co-Curriculum, and the International Conference on Teaching and
Learning with Technology. TCEF now brings the Arts Education Conference
(AEC), the ELIS Conference (ELISC) and the Physical and Sports Education
Conference (PSEC) together as one.</p>
