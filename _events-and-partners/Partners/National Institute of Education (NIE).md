STAR partners with the National Institute of Education (NIE) on long-term research and development projects that address pertinent issues relating to music education in Singapore.

STAR and NIE also collaborate on upskilling programmes, such as the Advanced Diploma in Primary Art/Music Education. Recent initiatives included the study ‘_Towards Responsive Professional Development (PD) for Singapore Music Teachers_’, which shed light on teachers’ experiences of video-mediated online PD, as well as the establishment of a video repository containing illustrations of good music teaching practices in Singapore classrooms.
