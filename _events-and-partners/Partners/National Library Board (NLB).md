STAR’s partnership with National Library Board includes receiving their support in the development of Teaching Living Legends, a professional development programme to enhance teachers’ awareness and their teaching of living music traditions in Singapore.

Since then, the National Library Board has enriched music teaching resources through the sharing of audio-visual resources. In addition, National Library Board is regularly invited to share with music teachers about their online resources.

For more information about the online resources at National Library Board, please refer to their [website](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/Pages/About).
