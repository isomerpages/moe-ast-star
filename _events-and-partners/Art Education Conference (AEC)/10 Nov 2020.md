The conference theme for e-AEC 2020 is _Arts for the Future: Imagining Possibilities_. Arts educators were invited to collaborate and co-create possibilities for teaching and learning in arts education for the new decade in the midst of an evolving education landscape. The conference also highlighted how sharing knowledge and pedagogical expertise with each other will synergise and give rise to new ideas and practices that strengthen the arts fraternity to better meet the needs of our students through a teacher-led culture.
