**About Drawing Symposium 2020**

In place of the annual Museum Education Symposium, STAR hosted our inaugural Drawing Symposium in January 2020. The full-day symposium seeks to deepen the theoretical underpinnings for drawing as core module with the intent to highlight the significance of drawing as fundamental and integral to art learning.

**Objectives**  

*   Deepen teachers’ appreciation and understanding of concept of drawing
*   Investigate a spectrum of drawing strategies; drawing resources to support the teaching and learning of art; and
*   Strengthen teachers’ knowledge of inquiry-based approaches to teaching and learning through studio practices and discussion on drawing.
