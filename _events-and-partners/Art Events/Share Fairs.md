The CI Projects Share Fair takes place in October and provides a platform for our teacher-researchers from both the CI NLC and CI Project: Priming the Art Classroom to share the insights of their research experiences to the larger art teachers’ fraternity. Their sharing centered on themselves as reflective practitioners who trailed pedagogical practices and ways they reimagined spaces in their art classrooms that impacted students’ learning.
