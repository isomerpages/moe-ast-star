## MUS.E.S Museum Education Symposium

![5.2.3 MUSES 4](/images/5-2-3-muses-4.jpg)

**2019 MUS.E.S Intersections and Transformation**

MUS.E.S centers around inquiry-based approaches to art teaching and learning in museum and gallery settings. Teachers get to learn about teaching from art collections and special exhibitions from museum educators. In addition, to working directly with artists through hands-on workshops, and immersing themselves in conversations about Singapore culture and heritage, teachers will also hear local and overseas thought leaders in the field of museum education.
