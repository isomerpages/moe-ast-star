## STAR Logo

The STAR logo embodies the fundamental idea of a luminous star, with many unique individual spheres coming together to form a cogent whole. Each sphere represents an arts teacher, with his/her own teacher agency, radiating passion and illuminating inspiration. Held together by each sphereâ€™s gravitational force, this collaborative confluence symbolises us, the arts teaching fraternity.

This unique star burst represents the distinctive academy that STAR is: created for the fraternity, with the fraternity. As the academy continues to grow and mature, STAR is encouraged by your presence as a stellar teaching fraternity in supporting one another through strong networks, collaborative learning groups, and seminar sharing. There is momentum and energy in the renewed lenses of reframing how our teaching and learning becomes more impactful in student-centric classrooms.

We encourage your continued participation in making the arts classrooms collaborative and creative, and in giving STAR feedback on how we can better share our metacognitive processes on the premise of a sound Singapore arts education. Join us to see more of what excellent arts teaching is about.
