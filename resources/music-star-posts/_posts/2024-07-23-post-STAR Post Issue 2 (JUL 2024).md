<p><strong>STAR-Post&nbsp;(Music) Heart beat: The Heart of Education</strong> celebrates
the heart of music education. We reflect on how as music educators, we
are driven by our heart for others, which compels us to listen to them
with care and compassion. Like heartstrings, we are all connected; our
heart for education and for music binds us together as one music teaching
fraternity.</p>
