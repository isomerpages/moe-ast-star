**_STAR-Post (Art): Art Education in the Globalised World_** 
explores three pertinent agendas for us as art teachers as we celebrate the start of a new year. First, we harness differentiated instruction to design thoughtful lessons and teaching resources to better facilitate our students’ learning. According to American educator and author Carol Ann Tomlinson, differentiating instruction is respectful teaching by teachers with a student-first orientation. Next, by leveraging the strengths of our students, we are also developing them to be future-ready. You will find inspiring ideas on how some of our teachers seize opportunities to empower students through robust and diverse learning experiences. Lastly, as we gear up for the evolution in the local education landscape and changing demands of the global economy, we need to be aware of how assessment and feedback could further support meaningful learning experiences in the art classroom. Amidst this itinerary, we should not forget our roles as Teacher-artists. We inspire our students as we role-model what it means to be learning continually as we immerse ourselves in the creative processes, discovering new insights and fueling our artistic passions.
