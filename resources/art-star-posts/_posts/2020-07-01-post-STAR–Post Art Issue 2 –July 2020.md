STAR-Post Art Issue 2 / July 2020

**STAR-Post (Art): A Re-imagined Culture of Care through Art** explores the many ways 'care' is folded into our teaching practice as art teachers, even as we navigate all the changes brought about by COVID-19. Art teachers meticulously plan ways of teaching that foster students' interests, strengths, choice and voice. Art teachers courageously lead their students and colleagues to use their abilities to care for our community, and advocate for inclusivity in the classroom. Art teachers also generously support each other through networks, and share their practice and top tips. We hope the many articles in this issue will continue to inspire and uplift your teaching practice at a point when we are called to re-imagine education!
