What should a 21st century music classroom look like? How might music education develop 21st century competencies (21CC) in our students? In what ways can the student’s voice be empowered through the music classroom? These important and timely questions lie at the heart of the quartet of papers selected for publication which affirms our teachers' commitment to empowering students' voices and developing the 21st century learner musically.
