**Sounding the Teaching VII: Imagining Possibilities in Changing Times**

!\[\](/images/sttvii.png)

This e-publication features 20 studies conducted by teachers from STAR’s Music Critical Inquiry Networked Learning Community (CI NLC).

The theme ‘Imagining Possibilities in Changing Times’ was conceived to encourage teachers to explore innovations in their respective changing classroom contexts such as transiting out of the COVID-19 pandemic or embarking on the Full Subject-Based Banding initiative to engage heterogenous classes.

Through the CI NLC, teachers exercised adaptability, creativity, and criticality in leading innovation to enhance teaching and learning in the music classroom.

Their teaching approaches and findings are presented according to the six SkillsFuture for Educators (SFEd) areas:

1.  Social and Emotional Learning
2.  Assessment for Learning
3.  Differentiated Instruction
4.  e-Pedagogy
5.  Inquiry-Based Learning
6.  Supporting Students with Special Education Needs
