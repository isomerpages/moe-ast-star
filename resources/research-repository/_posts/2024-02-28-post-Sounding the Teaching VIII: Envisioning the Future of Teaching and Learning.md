<p>This e-publication features 10 studies conducted by teachers from STAR's
Music Critical Inquiry Networked Learning Community (CI NLC).</p>
<p>In envisioning the future of teaching and learning, the critical inquiry
projects of the networked learning community led to three themes that could
take music teaching forward: embracing authenticity, nurturing learning
attributes, and empowering learner-assessors.</p>
<p>Through the CI NLC, teachers developed innovative teaching and learning
approaches leveraging the uniqueness of music to empower students in this
age of new literacies and 21CC development.</p>
