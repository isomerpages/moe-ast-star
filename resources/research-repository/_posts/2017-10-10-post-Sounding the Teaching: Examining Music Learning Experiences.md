This publication presents insights and findings from seven music teacher-leaders, who embarked on critical inquiry projects to investigate how their learners experience their lessons in the areas of music composition, music performance, music learning, music assessment and the mentoring process. A variety of approaches were used to examine their own music teaching practices and we hope that the reflections on their own assumptions and practices could inspire us to also reconsider and re-examine the ways we engage our students.
