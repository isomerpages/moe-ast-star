“Investigating art: National Gallery Singapore” is a publication made up of 13 booklets and 11 sets of image cards, archived here as a series of 13 PDF files. [Booklet 1](https://go.gov.sg/investigating-art-ngs-intro) consists of a curatorial essay, while booklet 2 to 11 consist of information on 10 artists and their respective artworks, gallery teaching ideas and short activities, as well as re-printable image cards. [Booklet 12](https://go.gov.sg/investigating-art-ngs-about) contains brief description about The Gallery, and [Booklet 13](https://go.gov.sg/investigating-art-ngs-ref) list the references used for the publication. The texts provide teachers with contextual information on the artworks and artists, empowering teachers to control the role of information as they plan meaningful dialogues and discussions on artworks. Together with the first publication, "Investigating art: Ideas on museum-based learning", art teachers will gain a deeper understanding of an inquiry-based approach to art teaching.
