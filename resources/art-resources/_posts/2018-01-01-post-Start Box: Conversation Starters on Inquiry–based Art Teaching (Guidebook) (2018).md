This kit can be used by art teachers to support their professional conversations and discussions on teaching practices. This kit can be used as a quick reference during subject-based, level-based, school-based or cluster-based STP-related professional learning platforms. The two deck of cards contain question prompts that can be used during these discussions. A study guide provides art teachers with bite-size notes on inquiry-based learning (IBL) in art. It also contains bite-size notes on Pedagogical Practices (PP) outlined in the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP).
