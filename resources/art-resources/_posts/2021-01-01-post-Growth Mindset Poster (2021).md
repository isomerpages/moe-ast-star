Growth Mindset Poster is a visual reminder of the importance of adopting a growth mindset (Dweck, 2006). According to psychologist Professor Dweck, people with a growth mindset believe that intelligence, personality, and abilities can be developed.  
  
This poster can help:  
1) remind teachers to acknowledge students' efforts by giving specific positive feedback when students demonstrate learning and good attitude to learning; and  
2) remind students to think positively, and inspire each other to try harder.
