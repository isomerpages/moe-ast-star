Drawing is a core learning experience in the 2018 revised Primary art syllabus and integral in the Secondary and Junior College art curriculum. Drawing Inspirations is a teaching resource kit consisting of 20 unique drawing lesson ideas categorized in 5 different sets designed to support art teachers with a myriad of different ways drawing could be facilitated in the art classrooms.  
  
This series of sample bite-sized videos are designed to illustrate how each of these drawing inspirations cards could be used to inspire and facilitate students to record experiences, give form to thoughts and feelings, make light and sound visible, discover perspectives and co-create layers of meaning through drawing.
