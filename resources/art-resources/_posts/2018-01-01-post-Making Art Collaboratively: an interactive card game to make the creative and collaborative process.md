This kit can be used by students and teachers to learn about the creative and collaborative process. Designed to be an interactive tool that supports the facilitation of group work or collaborative art projects, the "Making Art Collaboratively" kit contains four distinct decks of cards that denote various stages of the collaborative process. The four card categories are: role, ideation, play and feedback.
