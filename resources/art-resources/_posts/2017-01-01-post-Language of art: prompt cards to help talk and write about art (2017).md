_Language of Art_ aims to equip art teachers and students with art vocabulary. It provides users with a common set of vocabulary to understand and talk about art in our classrooms and museums.

 Teachers can use this teaching resource to:

*   find curated lists of words to help their students talk and write about art
*   create an Art Word Wall to teach art vocabulary by making reference to the lists of words
*   use images on the cards to introduce an art form

This publication consists of a guidebook, 11 General cards, 15 Art Forms cards, and 25 Blank Cards for teachers to create their own cards.
