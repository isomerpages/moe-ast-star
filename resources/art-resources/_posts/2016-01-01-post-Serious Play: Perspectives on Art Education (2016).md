The essays and research articles in this monograph are devoted to encouraging art teachers to infuse play into their teaching practices. These texts encourage the reader to relook, rethink and reframe the notion of “Play” in learning. Playing is a natural process of any child engaging, experiencing, experimenting and learning. _Serious play_ entails multiple non-linear pathways of thinking that lead to innovative choices and creations. Serious play, when well facilitated, can engage students to ideate, explore, and stretch the possible. Having play infused into the art curriculum can lead to more creative and artistic outcomes.
