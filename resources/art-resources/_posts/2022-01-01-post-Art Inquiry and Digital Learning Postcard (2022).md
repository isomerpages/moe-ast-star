This printable, double-sided A5-sized postcard makes connections between the Art Inquiry Model and possible ways to leverage EdTech, digital tools and content to facilitate art inquiry.  
  
One side of the postcard describes how different EdTech can be used to support art learning or digital art creation. The other side of the postcard contains 10 question prompts to help art teachers decide if a digital tool should be used in the art classroom.
