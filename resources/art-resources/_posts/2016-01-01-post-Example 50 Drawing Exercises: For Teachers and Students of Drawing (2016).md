This book contains drawing exercises and explanation of art terms related to drawing. Drawing is a powerful medium for self-expression, and the learning of drawing supports the development of skills of perception, communication and invention. This book project was possible from the collaboration with Editors Martin Constable and Chen Yanyun, and many international contributors credited in the book, as well as funding from the Joint-Working Committee on Arts Education. The project is also supported by Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth, and Ministry of Education; National Arts Council; and NTU School of Art Design and Media.
