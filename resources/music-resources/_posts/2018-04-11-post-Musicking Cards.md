2018, is a pedagogical resource that equips teachers to facilitate critical
thinking and creative expression in students, while inculcating in students
the musical vocabulary to describe their ideas.</p>

<p>As an extension of this pedagogical resource, this thumb drive consists
supporting teaching resources in the form of lesson ideas and lesson enactment
videos that describe and demonstrate how teachers can use the Musicking
Cards meaningfully to help students to develop that compositions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The lesson ideas are designed to make visible the pedagogical decisions
and considerations in using various sets of cards for different lesson
contexts, in tandem with the teaching actions. ion addition, the lesson
enactment ideas show how teachers can apply different pedagogical and facilitation
moves using the cards to provide students opportunities to think deeper
about their musical ideas and develop richer musical understandings in
relation to the learning objectives of the respective music syllabuses.</p>
