The Engaging with Songs pedagogical resource kit is designed to support teachers in the delivery of music lessons by providing a repository of songs. There are scores for more than 340 songs organised by tone sets and scales. These are accompanied by a pack of cards presenting lesson ideas, framed by STAR’s Experience-Concept-Application (ECA) approach.   
  
This resource kit is given to music teachers at our pedagogical milestone programmes and Engaging with Songs programme.
